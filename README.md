# M4 lab
The main purpose of this lab is to design a 4-bit multiplier in Modelsim using SystemVerilog.In the folder, you should see a multiplier, the top hierarchy design, a register which takes in the operand value and multiply it with the multiplicand, a sequencer, the control unit, and a reg_m which retrives the value of the multiplicand. Additionally, a multiplier testbench file is also included in this folder so that you can test this design yourself.

Below is the ASM chart we were asked to design.
